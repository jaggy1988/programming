My name is Jagatheesh. I live in Colorado USA.

I'm currently learning python.
I'm making progress in creating codes and maintaining them in remote code repository such as git hub. Im learning to reuse and organize the codes for usability.

Network device can be configured using programming language. 
I'm interested in learning how to configure Network devices securely and push the configuration to several devices at once.
Vendor neutral devices are currenly in boom and i love creating new things.
